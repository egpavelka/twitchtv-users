USE THE TWITCH.TV JSON API
_______________

Another Free Code Camp project.

Project Objectives:

--Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/

-- I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.

-- I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.

-- If a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

-- I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.
